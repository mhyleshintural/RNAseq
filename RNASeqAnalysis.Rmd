# Set-up

library(limma)

# Data packaging
## Reading in count data

```{r}
rawdata <- read.csv(file.choose(), header=TRUE)
files <- rawdata
x <- readDGE(files, columns=c(1,3))
class(x)

# I'm so sorry I don't know how to progress, there aren't 9 files for this like the easy as 123 paper so I'm confused as to what I need to do next, do I just import it through the Import Dataset button?
```
